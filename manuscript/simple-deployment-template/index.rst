Simple Deployment Template
==========================

This section describes *one* way to deploy a BigchainDB network.
You can modify it as you see fit.
It's "simple" in the sense that each BigchainDB node is installed
and run on a single virtual machine (or real machine).
We also have a :ref:`kubernetes-deployment-template` (not simple).
